This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Storybook

To work with the components, open [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/):

```bash
npm run storybook
```

It opens on [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) - and you can also learn more about [writing stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories).

### Joy UI
This is one of the [core products](https://mui.com/core/) of MUI, the organization behind Material Design used by Google. It's a component library that offers easy theming, but without being too opinionated. Take a look here to learn more:

- [Customization approaches](https://mui.com/joy-ui/customization/approaches/)
- [Theme viewer](https://mui.com/joy-ui/customization/default-theme-viewer/)
- [Theme colors](https://mui.com/joy-ui/customization/theme-colors/#default-color-tokens)

#### Customization
For the most part, just the global variables needs customization to align with the desired design. These can be adjusted by [extending the theme](https://mui.com/joy-ui/main-features/global-variants/#customizing-global-variants), and further customization can be done by getting to know the library of components, for instance the [Button component](https://mui.com/joy-ui/react-button/) and its [Button API](https://mui.com/joy-ui/api/button/).
